    <p><h2>Mom's spaghetti Bolognese recipe</h2></p>
    <p>passed on from my Italian grandfather. The ultimate comfort food. Leftovers freeze nicely!
    To make this recipe more authentic, <p>you can use a mixture of ground veal, pork, and beef. 
    You can also substitute 1/2 cup of red wine for the balsamic vinegar.</p></p>
    <p><p><h2>Ingredients</h2></p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (16 ouce) Package Spaghetti</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>3 strips bacon, diced</li>
        <li>1 large onion, finely chopped</li>
    </ul></p>
    <p><h2>Method</h2></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Stir in spaghetti 
            and return to a boil. Cook spaghetti uncovered, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm 
            to the bite, about 12 minutes; drain.</li>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat; add bacon. Cook, turning occasionally, until 
            crisp, 8 to 10 minutes. Add onion, celery, carrot, and oregano to bacon; continue cooking until
             vegetables begin to soften, 8 to 10 minutes. Add garlic; cook until fragrant, about 2 minutes. 
             Crumble in ground beef; cook and stir until no longer pink and completely cooked, 8 to 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Pour vinegar over ground beef mixture; simmer until liquid evaporates, about 5 minutes. 
            Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, and sugar; bring to a boil, season with salt and black pepper, 
            then remove from heat. Stir in basil .</li>
        <li>Spoon sauce over spaghetti; top with Parmesan cheese to serve.</li>
    </ol>
