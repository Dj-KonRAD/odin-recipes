    <p><h2>Odin's Delicious Lasagne Recipe</h2></p>
    <p>A colorful, tasty dish. Served with garlic bread, this vegetarian lasagne 
        makes an excellent meal for guests.</p>
        <p><ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>3 onions, chopped</li>
            <li>1 green bell pepper, chopped</li>
            <li>1 red bell pepper, chopped</li>
        </ul></p>
    </ul></p>
    <p><h2>Method</h2></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the oil in a large saucepan. Add the onions and saute for 3 minutes. Add the peppers and 
            saute for 2 minutes. Add the zucchini and saute 3 minutes before adding the tomatoes, tomato 
            paste, garlic and oregano, basil, thyme, salt and pepper. Cover the saucepan and simmer for 
            20 to 30 minutes (the longer the better as long as the sauce is not sticky.)</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 200 degrees F (95 degrees C). Grease a 9x13 inch baking dish.</li>
        <li>While the sauce cooks, melt 2 tablespoons butter in a saucepan. Add the flour into the butter, 
            stir vigorously for 2 minutes. Gradually add the milk, stirring until the sauce thickens. 
            Stir in the cheese, reserving as much as you will want to sprinkle on top of the lasagna. 
            Stir the cheese into the flour and butter mixture until it has melted completely. Season with nutmeg, 
            salt, and pepper.</li>
        <li>Soak the lasagna noodles in water for 30 seconds.</li>
    </ol>
